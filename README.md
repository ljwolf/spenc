# Spatially-Encouraged Spectral Clustering
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/129973633.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/129973633)

This repository provides the code & walks through how to use spatially-encouraged spectral clustering. Refer to the [example notebook](https://github.com/ljwolf/spenc/blob/master/example.ipynb) for more information on usage. 

Usage reqiures `scikit-learn` and `scipy`. The package is released on pypi as `spenc`, so installation is available using:

`pip install spenc`
